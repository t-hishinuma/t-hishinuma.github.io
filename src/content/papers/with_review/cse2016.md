# Abstract

We propose directive-based automatic code generation for a multiple-precision code from a C code with double precision.The multiple-precision code uses the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).Our code generation functions can be separated into binary operations by automatically creating a temporary variable, transforming C mathematical functions into corresponding GMP functions, and managing functions that return a double-precision value.Our proposed system enables users to check the accuracy dependency of many algorithms by adding a few directives to C codes with double precision.
